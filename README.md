Hi, I'm Ilham Brilliandi. I'm a fresh graduate student majoring at mathematics in Brawijaya University. I have a heavy passionate towards data science since college. Here's a simple tour on projects i've done since 2023.


# [Project 1: Data Analysis - E-Commerce](https://github.com/ilhambrilliandi/da_e-commerce)
### Overview:
Conducted an end-to-end analysis of a 3-year e-commerce dataset to uncover sales trends, identify top products, and assess seller performance.

### Key Steps:
- Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, normalized sales figures, and categorized product types.
- Visualization: Created interactive dashboards using [Looker](studio.google.com/u/1/reporting/05bab6a5-2092-44d0-a5d2-3db86ec9dbae) to visualize trends over time.

### Findings:
- Health & Beauty emerged as the top-selling category over three years.
- Peak transaction times occurred on Mondays at 4 PM.

### Recommendations:
- Implement targeted promotions for top products and peak transaction times (e.g., discounts or free delivery).
- Engage new customers with targeted offers on both high and low-selling products.

### Impact:
This analysis can help drive marketing strategies and inventory management, ultimately enhancing sales performance.



# [Project 2: Data Analysis - Employee Promotion](https://github.com/ilhambrilliandi/da_predictemployeepromotions)
### Overview:
Analyzed employee promotion data to identify key factors influencing promotions and departmental performance.

### Key Steps:
- Modeling: Tested six machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, SVM, and LightGBM, addressing overfitting with techniques such as resampling and hyperparameter tuning.
- Visualization: Used Seaborn and Matplotlib to visualize promotion rates across departments.

### Findings:
- 429 employees (3.3%) are predicted for promotion in 2024.
- Education level and department significantly influence promotion likelihood.

### Performance Metrics:
LightGBM achieved an accuracy of 85% with an F1 score of 0.78.

### Recommendations:
- Focus on training for Below Secondary employees to improve promotion rates.
- Utilize targeted recruitment strategies based on historical data.

### Impact:
Insights can help HR develop tailored training programs and recruitment strategies.



# [Project 3: Machine Learning - Identifying Rock, Paper, Scissors](https://github.com/ilhambrilliandi/ml_cv_classificationrps)
### Overview:
Developed a convolutional neural network using TensorFlow to classify images of hand gestures for the Rock, Paper, Scissors game.

### Key Steps:
- Data Augmentation: Enhanced the training dataset with techniques like rotation and flipping to improve model robustness.
- Model Evaluation: Achieved an accuracy of 92% on the test set.
- Visualization: Included confusion matrices to show classification accuracy across the three classes.

### Impact:
This project demonstrates practical applications of image recognition, which can be extended to more complex gesture-based interfaces.



# [Project 4: Web Scraping - Automation Clicker Game](https://github.com/ilhambrilliandi/ws_automationcoockieclicker)
### Overview:
Developed a Selenium-based automation script to play the web game "[Cookie Clicker](https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/)", enhancing efficiency through automated clicks and upgrades.

### Key Steps:
Selenium Implementation: Automated browser interactions to simulate user behavior effectively.

### Results:
Increased in-game progress by 200% within a set time frame compared to manual gameplay.

### Impact:
This project showcases practical web scraping skills and automation techniques.



# [Project 5: Web Scraping - Extract Website Information](https://github.com/ilhambrilliandi/ws_extractwebsiteinformation)
### Overview:
Created a web scraper using Selenium to extract and save product information from a specific [e-commerce site](https://www.anwb.nl/auto/private-lease/anwb-private-lease/aanbod) into a CSV file.

### Key Steps:
Web Interacting: To simplify the scraping, I collect the information based on each categories.

### Impact:
This project highlights skills in data extraction and preparation for analysis.



# [Project 6: Sentiment Analysis: Social Media Posts](https://github.com/ilhambrilliandi/sa_socialmediaposts)
### Overview:
Performed sentiment analysis on social media posts from Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter using the BERT model.

### Key Steps:
- Data Collection: Scraped posts from each platform using APIs.
- Model Implementation: Utilized BERT for sentiment classification, achieving a classification accuracy of 87%.

### Findings:
Most posts across all platforms were positive, with engagement peaking during specific times.

### Challenges:
The model struggled with ambiguous sentiments (e.g., sarcasm), highlighting an area for future improvement.

### Impact:
The insights gained can inform marketing strategies and content creation for brands.
